\section{Introduction}

The project consists of being able to move a swarm of robots from a central room
to the best neighbouring room. The four target rooms on each side of the central
room are evaluated based on the average of 3 metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item the \textbf{ground color} ($v_G \in [0,1]$),
    \item the \textbf{light intensity} ($v_L \in [0,1]$),
    \item the proportion of \textbf{objects} ($v_O \in [0,1]$ from the number
    of objects
$\in [2,12]$).
\end{itemize}

\noindent There are 2 types of robots, ground robots and light robots. Both of
them can evaluate the number of objects with an omnidirectional camera. Only the
ground robots can evaluate the ground color, and only the light robots can
evaluate the light intensity.\\

\noindent In order to attain the best room, the swarm must spread, evaluate rooms and
collectively decide on which is the best room.
