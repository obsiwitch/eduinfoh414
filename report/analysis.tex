\section{Analysis \& Problems}
% TODO analysis

% TODO problems
%   * no diversification
%       * ideas not implemented (or did not work well):
%           * assign robots randomly to rooms, evaluate, restart from beginning
%           of state machine multiple times
%           * room assignment at the beginning or the program
%   * multiple forces
%       * behaviour difficult to predict
%       * robots wandering outside rooms
%       * collisions (split vs gathering)
%   * more robots -> get stuck more easily
